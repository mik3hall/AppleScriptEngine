# AppleScriptEngine
### dylib of the formerly Apple provided scripting JSR 223 implemention for AppleScript

Apple provided the source for this to the macports project when it was going to the jdk. I took a copy then and made a standalone dylib version.

I have saved the original build as a release. AppleScriptEngine X86.

Currently I have included what is needed to build it ARM architecture. Including a needed libJavaNativeFoundation.dylib. For more
information on that see [JavaNativeFoundation](https://github.com/mik3hall/JavaNativeFoundation_arm_dylib)
